This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Tutorial Source
This project was created by following the official Next.js tutorial available on the Next.js website. The tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to building web applications with Next.js, and I highly recommend checking it out for an in-depth learning experience

Open [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) to see the tutorial.

Open [financial-dashboard](https://financial-dashboard-git-main-iraklis-projects-2a13912e.vercel.app/) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learning Journey
ðŸš€ Exciting News! I've recently completed the Next.js dashboard course, and this project is the result of that journey. Key features I loved and implemented in this project include:

App Router - File Based Routing System: Next.js simplifies navigation with an intuitive file-based routing system. Check out the improved structure in the pages directory!

Automatic Code Splitting and Prefetching: Experience lightning-fast performance with Next.js's automatic code splitting and prefetching. Only load what's needed, when it's needed.

Image and Font Optimization: Forget manual optimizationsâ€”Next.js takes care of image and font optimization for improved performance without the extra effort.

Server Components for Data Fetching: Embrace server components for seamless server-side data fetching, leading to better performance and improved SEO.

Static Rendering and Dynamic Rendering: Choose between static and dynamic rendering for the flexibility your project needs. Optimize for static content or leverage dynamic rendering for real-time updates.
